# CONMAN

Conman is a plugabble configuration management library.

- **Centralize**: Add as many sources in the order you prefer to your config. You can use existing sources or define your own.

- **Dependable**: You are guaranteed the sources are built in order from first to last, overriding any overlapping key. Your configuration can be stored in a file, for persistence and audibility.

- **Refreshable**: Based on a TTL, the config rebuilds in the background, or you can trigger a rebuild manually at any point in time.
